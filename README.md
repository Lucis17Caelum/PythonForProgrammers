# IntroductionToPython
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.

**NOTE:** If you're trying to run the RollDieDynamic.py script in Chapter 1 and the window does not appear, this is due to a known issue in the software for which a fix is already in process. You can instead run the program with 

>`ipython -i RollDieDynamic.py 6000 1`
    
Then terminate IPython interactive mode (Ctrl + D twice) after you close the script's window.
